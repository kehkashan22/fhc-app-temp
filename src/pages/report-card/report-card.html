        What is A, B, C breakup?
      </h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        On the basis of exam papers of past 10 years, Farooq Sir has designed an analysis system keeping in mind the statistics that came out from
         past experience and keen understanding of the working of the exam. In this
        system all chapters of each subject are divided into three categories: <b>A, B</b> and <b>C</b>.
      </p>
      <p>On an average (as seen in the past 10 years), the breakup of scores for each topic is as follows:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th text-center>Chapter Type</th>
          <th text-center>Marks (out of 100)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td text-center>A</td>
          <td text-center>60</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td text-center>B</td>
          <td text-center>30</td>
        </tr>
           <tr>
          <td text-center>C</td>
          <td text-center>10</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Similarly, each type has further been divided into three sub-types:</p>
      <p text-center><b>Application, Speed</b> and <b>Memory,</b> </p>
      <p>with different weightage alloted to each category in each chapter type.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>In topics of type <b>A</b> most questions are based on <b>Application</b> and only a few on Memory and Speed.</p></li>
        <li><p>In topics of type <b>B</b> most questions are based on <b>Memory</b> and only a few on Application and Speed.</p></li>
        <li><p>In topics of type <b>C</b> almost all topics are <b>Memory</b> based.</p></li>
      </ol>

      <p>This test series has been devised to accurately project the aggregate marks a student should expect in their CA/CS exam, based on the number
        of quizzes of each type and sub-type solved. Plus, for each quiz, chapter and type, individual average scores have also been calculated.
      </p>

      <p>Solve as many quizzes as possible for the best assessment. Best of Luck and happy Learning!</p>
