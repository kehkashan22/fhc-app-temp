        What is A, B, C breakup?
      </h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        On the basis of exam papers of past 10 years, Farooq Sir has devised a scientifically accurate analysis system. In this
        system all chapters of each subject are divided into three categories: <b>A, B</b> and <b>C</b>.
      </p>
      <p>On an average (as seen in the past 10 years), the breakup of scores for each topic is as follows:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Chapter Type</th>
          <th>Marks (out of 100)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td text-center>A</td>
          <td text-center>60</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td text-center>B</td>
          <td text-center>30</td>
        </tr>
           <tr>
          <td text-center>C</td>
          <td text-center>10</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Similarly, each chapter has further been divided into three sub-categories:</p>
      <p text-center><b>Application, Speed</b> and <b>Memory,</b> </p>
      <p>with different weightage alloted to each category in each chapter type.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>In category <b>A</b> topics most questions are based on <b>Application</b> and only a few on Memory and Speed</p></li>
        <li><p>In category <b>B</b> topics most questions are based on <b>Memory</b> and only a few on Application and Speed</p></li>
        <li><p>In category <b>C</b> almost all topics are <b>Memory</b> based</p></li>
      </ol>

      <p>This test series has been devised to accurately project the aggregate marks a student should expect in their CA/CS exam, based on the number
        of quizzes of each type and sub-type solved. Plus, for each quiz, chapter and type, individual average scores have also been calculated.
      </p>

      <p>So one must try to give as many quizzes as possible for an accurate assessment.</p>
