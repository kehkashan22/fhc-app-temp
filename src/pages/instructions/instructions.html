      <h4>How to Study?</h4>

      <hr class="hr">
      <p>Effective study is an elusive and complex process involving various steps,
         requiring application of certain skills in the most optimized manner. At FHC we have developed a series of
         videos and tests that will help you experience the difference between <b>"study"</b> and <b>"effective study".</b>
  
    </p>
   <h3><u>Analysis Pattern:</u></h3>
   <p>Video 1 -> Quiz 1 <br> Video 2 -> Quiz 2</p>
   <p>You will first see a video of a certain topic, explained in a straightforward, bland manner, and will be required to
     give a test on that topic. After the first quiz, you will again be faced with another video on the same topic, this time explained in the unique
     style of Farooq Sir. Once this video is over, another test will be presented. Finally you will receive a comparison of the two scores
     you got with a customized analysis.
   </p>
    <p>All this will help you score high and reach your targets with ease.</p>

    <b><i>Note:</i></b><i>&nbsp;It is recommended that you give the entire analysis in one sitting to ensure an accurate analysis.</i>
